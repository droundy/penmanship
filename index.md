## a

![letter a](a.svg)

The letter is actually pretty hard to get wrong.  About the only thing I've encountered (and pretty rarely) is a "fancy" a.  Just don't do anything fancy, and you won't risk your 'a' being misunderstood.  Note that there *is* a possibility of confusion with 'd' if you are sloppy, but a little care can avoid that problem.
